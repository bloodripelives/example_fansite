    <p>This is an example version of how I made my fic archive site that you can mess with or drop your own fic into to make it yours.</p>
<p>To mess with the menu on the main page, go to data/menu.toml</p>
<p>To add something to the main page that is static and it makes more sense to put in HTML, like a webring button, go to themes/nostyleplease/layouts/index.html</p>
<p>To change the site title, url, etc, go to hugo.toml</p>
<p>To put your own fic on here, go to content/fics and replace the existing files with your own fic in markdown format, following the format in the examples to set metadata. If you&rsquo;re coming from AO3, the easiest way to do this is probably to download your stories in html and use an html to markdown converter online to get them in markdown.</p>
<p>If you want to change how the site generally looks, go to themes/nostyleplease/assets/css/main.scss</p>
<p>To mess around with how fic and lists of fic display, go to /themes/nostyleplease/layouts/fics and uhhh well I&rsquo;m not really sure I&rsquo;m a bit fuzzy on the details of how hugo works beyond having set up my thing and knowing how to update it. But I think it happens here</p>
<p>To make new tags in existing taxonomies (fandom, category) you just have to add them to a new fic. To mess with what <em>kinds</em> of categories you have, er, mess around with stuff I guess? I suspect it&rsquo;s possible to make significantly more detailed categorization structures than I have here but I don&rsquo;t really know how and I set this up a while ago so I kind of forget how I did it. Look up taxonomies in hugo and get better at it than me&hellip;</p>
<p>To see how it looks, install hugo: <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/">https://gohugo.io/installation/</a> Then, from the top level directory, run &lsquo;hugo server&rsquo; and follow the link it gives you to see how the site would look. When you&rsquo;re happy with it, run <code>hugo</code> and a version of your website ready to be uploaded to the internet will appear in the public folder. Personally, I use rsync to upload it to my server which I included here as the script push.sh. Or just upload it however neocities or whatever else you&rsquo;re using handles file uploads.</p>
<p>If you notice that it&rsquo;s weird that there&rsquo;s duplication between the stuff in the themes folder and stuff outside of it you&rsquo;re correct. I tried migrating all the stuff in themes into the &ldquo;main&rdquo; part of the directory structure but it broke stuff I couldn&rsquo;t figure out. Disclaimer: I&rsquo;m bad at this and doing it my way is probably bad.</p>
<p>If you want to ask me questions or tell me how to actually use this thing come find me on the fediverse <a href="https://federatedfandom.net/@bloodripelives">https://federatedfandom.net/@bloodripelives</a> or email me <a href="mailto:tei@fastmail.org">tei@fastmail.org</a></p>
